# **what is your story?**

have you ever been in a mascot suit? it's a weird experience putting it on. the inside of the suit of the animal or inanimate object you're about to bring to life looks nothing like the outside. pulling on the tights, strapping on the body and plonking the oversized helmet. and soon all you can see is a narrow view of the world through mesh grill... ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b6a4d0a-ace3-4f85-ae63-e234fa05c5f9.jpg)

but then you present yourself to the world, suddenly and small children (or small children trapped in old bodies) light up as if you are the most fantastically thing they've ever seen.   
_it's exactly the same for your story. _

the dream that motivated you to give all of your energy and attention to what you do day in and day out starts to feel awkward and uncomfortable and you feel trapped in a hot mess with nothing but mesh for you see through. the day-in-day-out of building and leading your organisation is so different and disconnected from how those on the outside see you and what you do.

_you need to be reminded of what you look like._

the story of success is simply the journey of helping you see yourself for how the world outside sees you. a hero. this is about taking a good long look in the mirror, to realise that you are living the dream and taking you on the journey to tell your story that describes the mascot and gathers those that want nothing more than to hug you, high five you and have a selfie with the larger than life character you are and cause you are   
fighting for.

my specialty is strategic marketing though story telling. i'll help you discover your story and equip you with the narrative techniques that will transform your brand communication to cut through through the noise and get you noticed.

_come discover your story of success._
